### Long Form Content
- [Engineering for a safer world](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/safer-world.pdf) - ðŸ“• Probably the best starting point for anyone entering token engineering to think about governance and automation in the same stream.

### Other Things
- [Token Engineering YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmzlpzOlaTALYV0hAwT0Tg) - ðŸ“º  cornucopia of token engineering lectures. 
- [Commons Stack YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoyHywZn8YMalyx4ZbvQoyw) - ðŸ“º super cool stuff about CommonsStack and CadCAD.
- [BlockScience resources page](https://block.science/resources/) - ðŸ“º ðŸ“„ ðŸ“• A curation of resources related to token engineering.
- [Token Engineering Learning Program](https://www.tannrallard.tech/token-engineering-learning-program/) - General introduction to the process and access to helpful materials.
- [Token Engineering Wiki](http://tokenengineering.wikidot.com/) - A glorious archive of tokeneconomic treasures. 
- [CadCAD Tutorials](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD/tree/master/tutorials) - A collection of CadCAD tutorials (may or may not be up to date).

## Conviction Voting 
- [BlockScience conviction voting Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/BlockScience/conviction/blob/master/cic_initialization.ipynb) - Such code. Many maths.
- [1Hive conviction voting chat](https://keybase.io/team/1hive) - This is where most of the in depth discussions happen around 1Hive's conviction voting implementation, but to join you have to create a Keybase account, join the 1Hive team chat, and then add yourself to the #conviction-voting chat.
- [1Hive conviction voting Discord chat](https://discord.gg/5D482sd) - Easy to join, but less activity.


## Notes

> Would be great to showcase 1-3 cases covering various steps of the total process initial vision > stakeholder map > system design > selecting component > simulations > behavioral data & attack vectors > security > living digital twin.

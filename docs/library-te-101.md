### Intro Materials
- [Cryptoeconomics 101](https://aracred.github.io/website/blog/Cryptoeconomics%20101) - ðŸ“„ A high level overview to start to orient intuition around the token engineering process.
- [Glossary of systems concepts](https://community.cadcad.org/t/working-glossary-of-systems-concepts/17) - ðŸ“„ An overview of the lineage of token engineering. 
- [Token engineering in practice](https://youtu.be/xRqXAlpWl0Y) - ðŸ“º As advertised.
- [Towards a diversity of DAOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75769EjciVk) - ðŸ“º Technologically enabled social systems: DAOs.
- [Differential Specification Syntax Key](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31) - ðŸ“„ How to read (and create) diagrams in the CadCAD ecosystem.
- [Token Engineering Fundamentals (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsRG9uZmME8) - ðŸ“º 1 hour overview of token engineering and all the things related to it (spoiler alert: it's not all about tokens).

### Long Form Content
- [Engineering for a safer world](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/safer-world.pdf) - ðŸ“• Probably the best starting point for anyone entering token engineering to think about governance and automation in the same stream.

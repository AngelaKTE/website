The Token Engineering Community is working to answer the following question: "What does it take to do "token engineering" and how we can do it together?" 

## So what is "token engineering?"

Token engineering is a holistic engineering discipline that goes all the way from ideation to design, testing, deployment, and maintentance. It's the process of building things that work, and keep working. Just like bridges and roads need to be reliable, so do our economic systems. Our goal is to help design and create tokeneconomic systems that are robust against exploits and can empower users.

### Define design goals

What do you want to have happen? What does success look like for your tokeneconomic system?

### Identify mechanisms

You want to design mechanisms where certain properties hold under all conditions. You know you have a mechanism when it cannot be broken down further.

### Compose mechanisms into design patterns

Design patterns are a series of actions that will produce consistent and reproducible results. Often this is state dependent.

### Model your system

It's much easier to test and iterate in python before getting a security audit and deploying your code to production.

### Test IRL

Theory only gets us so far. We need to start dogfooding the system in controlled and low-risk experiments.
